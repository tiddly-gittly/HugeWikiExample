```json
{
  "id": "pso1_scope2",
  "type": "GUNMOD",
  "name": {
    "str": "PSO-1 scope (fixed)"
  },
  "copy-from": "pso1_scope",
  "description": "A x4 scope, designed for the SVD-63.  It's side mounted, which does not interfer with the weapon's iron sights, sealed with nitrogen which prevents foggy sight, and has a characteristic reticle that helps compensate for bullet drop up to 1000 m.  It's somewhat bulky however, relative to other scopes.  This is fixed to the weapon, so it can't be removed.",
  "flags": [
    "IRREMOVABLE",
    "ZOOM"
  ]
}
```
