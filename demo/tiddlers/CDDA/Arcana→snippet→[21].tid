He is to be held in Sector Three subject containment cells due to the lack of a proper holding facility, to be questioned and turned over to the proper authorities pending the state of emergency being lifted.  Several items of anomalous nature were on his person and are being investigated due to possible connection with sensitive materials being handled by personnel assigned to Project Kairos.\""

In the event of a lockdown incident, Z-07 is to be activated and instructed to target all anomalous or unidentified biosigns.  Sector Three personnel are advised to keep their identification with them at all times, as it contains IFF signatures necessary for Z-07 to recognize and assist still-living personnel.\""

We have also discovered that a strong electromagnetic field can interact with these \"ripples\" while they are developing, reducing their propagation. if the origin point is contained in an electromagnetic bubble.\""

A slight decrease in the energy needed for a microportal to overcome resistance and begin manifesting.  We've been able to rule out variation in atmospheric conditions and resistance changes in the machine.  Our current research indicates this may amplify the ripple effects from spatial manipulation, but electromagnetic containment allows the ripple effect to be nullified.  Further research is required before we can report our findings, but there are growing concerns that time may be of the essence.\""

Daily test firings should continue until local spatial fluctuations normalize.  If all goes as planned, we just need to hold out for a month and it will be safe to continue to Phase 2.  Our hypothesis is that the ripple energy of a microportal, once contained, can be manipulated via other anomalous principles we've been researching.  This might enable directing that energy to somewhere that has suffered a dimensional fatigue incident, which may increase the resistance back to a level that would no longer allow for a portal to be self-sustaining.\""

We're trying to get in touch with the other facilities to notify them of a possible leak.  Either that or someone else is exploring similar fields without us knowing about it.  China, maybe?  The intruder seemed to be a civilian according to what records we have, but we're having trouble getting any recent information on him.

Most of the Sector Three personnel who survived either sheltered in place at the waiting room or decided to wait upstairs near the heavy security checkout.  A secondary explosion caused by the portal surge hitting its peak caused structural damage upstairs.  We've got a partial containment breach and a second mass casualty event.  Given the strained evacuation efforts in Sector Two and evidence of bioanomaly contamination, a large reanimation event might occur before evacuation can finish.\""
