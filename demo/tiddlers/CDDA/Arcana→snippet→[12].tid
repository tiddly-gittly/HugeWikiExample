Where the earth is marred by a fallen star, where stones defy gravity, fourteen of our faithful did commune with He From Beyond The Veil.  Half their number gave their lives to Him, so that seven high priests would bear seven holy weapons.  Now, we know of only one blade not yet lost to us.\""

Where the stars mark the earth, flying stones bind the evil that took our greatest hope from us.  We pray to He From Beyond The Veil, that we may live to reclaim it and guide this world back into the light.\""
