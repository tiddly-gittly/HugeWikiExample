    "no": "I'll keep it short and simple.  I got lucky, basically.  I was the last one left of my hunting party trying to meet up with any others.  I wasn't anywhere near the major cities or other hotspots, so I didn't find out anything was amiss until I reached this place and heard the news from Thane McKinnon herself."
