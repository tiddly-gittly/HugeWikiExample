    "Kill what's threatening you first, then treat any casualties.  It's cold sure, but every person out of the fight makes it easier on the enemy, and it's hard to shoot back when your hands are busy tying up some poor guy's guts.",
    "A well-placed grenade, stick of dynamite, or better yet C4 is as handy a tool as it is a weapon. If you have the time to place it and back off, you're less likely to make a costly mistake than throwing it.",
    "Take good care of any vehicles you can get in working order. A few tons of metal at highway speeds is deer medicine, as much as a couple hundred grains of it going supersonic is.",
    "It's only a rout if it's too little, too late to call it a retreat. Better off keeping your distance or breaking contact if it'd be too much trouble to fight it out.",
    "Don't bring what you don't need, but keep in mind you never know for sure what's necessary until you need it.  If you're still on the fence about a piece of gear and it won't hurt any to take it, you might as well bring it along.",
    "Being unsubtle about a mission is only a disadvantage if you don't have enough ammo for everything that might show up.",
    "Always bring a gun, preferably the biggest one you can afford to haul around.  Even if you're more the rip and tear type, it'll pay off eventually.",
    "Take your time aiming if you have the chance to.  Some of the things out there are tough but slow, shot placement's what saves your hide against things like that.",
    "If you're gonna be fighting monsters, either gear up for any threat that might be out there, or stay light.  If it slows you down it needs to be worth it."

    "先杀死威胁你的东西，然后治疗任何伤亡。当然很冷，但是每一个退出战斗的人都会让敌人更容易对付，而且当你的手忙着绑住某个可怜人的内脏时，很难反击。",
    "一枚放置得很好的手榴弹、一根炸药棒，或者更好的C4，既是一种武器，也是一种方便的工具。如果你有时间把它放好，然后放弃，那么你犯一个代价高昂的错误的可能性比扔掉它要小。",
    "好好保管好所有能正常行驶的车辆。以高速行驶的几吨金属是鹿药，而以超音速行驶的几百格令也是鹿药。",
    "如果它太小，太晚了，不能称之为撤退，那就是溃败。最好保持距离或断开联系，如果这样做太麻烦了。",
    "不要带你不需要的东西，但要记住，在你需要之前，你永远不知道什么是必要的。如果你仍然对一件装备犹豫不决，而且拿着它不会伤害任何人，那么你最好带着它。",
    "如果你没有足够的弹药来完成所有可能出现的任务，那么对任务不熟悉只是一个劣势。",
    "一定要带枪，最好是你能负担得起的最大的枪。即使你更喜欢撕扯式的，最终还是会有回报的。",
    "如果有机会，慢慢瞄准。有些事情很艰难，但很慢，投篮的位置可以让你避免这样的事情。",
    "如果你要和怪物战斗，要么准备好应对任何可能存在的威胁，要么保持低调。如果它让你慢下来，那就值得。"
