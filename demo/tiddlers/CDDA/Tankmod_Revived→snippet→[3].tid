      "text": "PATTON TANKS TO BE RESTORED - Amid rumors of war on the horizon and growing unrest, a recent new briefing outlined an emergency plan to restore and rearm several M60 Patton main battle tanks, with roughly two hundred projected to be available across the New England region within the coming weeks.  Officials refused to clarify the purpose of this rearmament program, leaving speculation that the move is an unintentional confirmation of an impending Chinese invasion.  According to an anonymous source within the military, \"They don't expect them to be facing Type 96 or 99 tanks.  They'll likely be used to engage IFVs such as the Type 08 or the Type 15 light tank.\""

      "text": "巴顿坦克将被修复！——在战争即将来临和日益动荡的传言中，最近一次新的简报概述了一项紧急计划，以修复和重新武装几辆 M60 巴顿主战坦克，预计在未来几周内将在新英格兰地区提供大约 200 辆。官员们拒绝澄清这一重新武装计划的目的，让人猜测此举是无意中证实了中国即将前来解放。据军方内部一位匿名消息人士透露，“他们预计这些坦克可能无法用于对抗 96 型或 99 型坦克，它们很可能被用来对付诸如 08 型或 15 型轻型坦克之类的 IFV。”"
