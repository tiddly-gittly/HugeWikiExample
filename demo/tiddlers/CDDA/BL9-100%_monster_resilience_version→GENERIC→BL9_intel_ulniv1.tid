  "description": "These alien species are native to a beautiful and dense jungle-like wildforests planet of Wanzeltiums, Ulniviunite are pangolin-like creatures, they breed and live in sandy cave areas located on shores of this planet, they have a body covered with slime coated thick and durable scales, underbelly and tail grotesquely fleshy and slimy, lamprey-type mouth with a menacingly looking set of teeth, long anteater-like tongue along with incredibly thick and sturdy claws on the end of it's limbs.\n \n    Obviously Wanzeltiums have brought them here, possibly for using them as experimental subjects for infusing with BL9 since it is the main reason 'Alliance' is here, we must approach them carefully, if they are infused with BL9 then many of them must have mutated as well",
