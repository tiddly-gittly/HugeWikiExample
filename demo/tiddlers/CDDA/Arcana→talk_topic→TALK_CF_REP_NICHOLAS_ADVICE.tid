  "dynamic_line": "We never learned much about these labs, not until after reports coming in from scavengers.  If they were involved in the arcane, or some other anomalous activity, then the Veil might be especially weak there.  We've already heard stories of abominations both earthly and otherworldly infesting these places, a lab of this nature will likely be even worse.  Be well-armed, make sure you have a path of escape before forcing your way in deeper.  Any written intel or warning signs you find down there might be of vital importance.",
