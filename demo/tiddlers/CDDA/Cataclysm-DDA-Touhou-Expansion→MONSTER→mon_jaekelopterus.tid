The head has the shape of a shovel's spade, with the compound eyes on top and a pair of big chelicera in front, the size and sharpness of butchering knives.  There are several pairs of legs, with the most striking being the first pair in front holding gigantic claws, and the last being flappy, meaty appendixes for locomotion at each side of the body.  At least the tail is just for showing.",
