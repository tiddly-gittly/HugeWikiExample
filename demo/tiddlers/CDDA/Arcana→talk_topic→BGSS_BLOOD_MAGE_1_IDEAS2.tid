  "dynamic_line": "The magi liked to isolate us from civilization at large.  Typical cult stuff now that I think about it, plus made it easier to cover our tracks.  But, for all the talk of preparation and adaptation, I don't know if they really predicted this, but our isolation kept us from suffering the same fate as those in the cities.  Now it's just a matter of surviving, I guess.",
