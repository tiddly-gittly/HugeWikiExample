Didn't seem even the least bit squeamish about the animals though.  Given she works for wherever we get our mutagen and CBMs, I don't want to even think about the shit they must be used to.  Didn't even fucking flinch when one of the freaks in Red Team broke its jaw gnawing on the bars, when she and the boss walked past its cell.\""

Boss is worried that vetting clients is going to make the next show a complete waste of time.  Told him we shouldn't have given up on streaming in favor of hosting fights on-site, but boss won't budge on that.\""

Think it knows we have to move it to another cell while we replace the shitter.  The boss is also looking to get his supplier to get their hands on some PE065, that should make it a bit easier to keep contained like the rest.  Might make the next show more fun too.\""

Going to lock primary access and hit full cell unlock, let the animals have fun tearing each others throats out.  Oughta keep them distracted so I can try and find out what the fuck is going on up there.\""
