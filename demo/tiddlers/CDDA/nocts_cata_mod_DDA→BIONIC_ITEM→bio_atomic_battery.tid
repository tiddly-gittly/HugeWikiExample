  "description": "An old form of non-thermal radioisotope generator, given new life and military applications using cutting-edge plutonium-catalyst developments.  Effectively a plutonium fuel cell converted into an alphavoltaic battery, with greater power output and longevity than older implants.  Its output is still very low at only 5 watts, but it also provides a continuous source of power, making it a good supplement to a more intensive power generation method.",
