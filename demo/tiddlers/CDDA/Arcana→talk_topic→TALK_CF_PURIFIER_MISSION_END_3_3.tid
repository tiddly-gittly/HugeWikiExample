Once it's ready, we'll have a device that can seal breaches and stabilize the fabric of the Veil, one area at a time.  It's not much, but it'll help.",

What it does is seal nearby breaches, helping stabilize the fabric of the Veil.  After all that's happened, it's not going to solve everything but it's an improvement."

    "no": "它使用与Kairos项目相同的操纵和控制裂痕的基本概念，以及如何操纵面纱的守护者和乐观主义者知识。它所做的是密封附近的裂口，帮助稳定面纱的织物。在这一切发生之后，它不会解决所有问题，但它是一种进步。"
