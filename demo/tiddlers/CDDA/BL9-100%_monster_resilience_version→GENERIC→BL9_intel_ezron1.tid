  "description": "These alien species are native to a volcanic canyons barren wasteland-like planet of Saldeniums, Ezrondium are arachnides resembling gigantic spiders, they breed and live in sandy cave areas located on shores of this planet, they have an enormous body from belly of which emerges a small worm-like protrusion, incredibly sharp and deadly looking elongated legs.\n \n    Obviously Saldeniums have brought them here, possibly for using them as experimental subjects for infusing with BL9 since it is the main reason 'Alliance' is here, we must approach them carefully, if they are infused with BL9 then many of them must have mutated as well",
