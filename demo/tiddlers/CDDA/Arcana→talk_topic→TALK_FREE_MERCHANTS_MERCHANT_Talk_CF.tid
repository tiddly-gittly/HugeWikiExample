{
  "id": "TALK_FREE_MERCHANTS_MERCHANT_Talk_CF",
  "type": "talk_topic",
  "dynamic_line": "Not many holdouts large enough to call a settlement, but there is activity out there at least.  We have our own work on getting something set up.  There's also a small group that occasionally sends traders to visit us, they're holed up in some old rural church.  The church's deacon stops by here fairly often though, should be out in the hallway.  Talk to him and he might be able to give you directions.",
