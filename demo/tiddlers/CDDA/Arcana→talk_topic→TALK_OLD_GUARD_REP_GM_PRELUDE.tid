  "id": "TALK_OLD_GUARD_REP_GM_PRELUDE",
  "type": "talk_topic",
  "dynamic_line": "I have received a number of reports about attacks, I assume you are tracking the cause on someone else's behalf?  I would like to help, but we are stretched thin as it is.  I've only had enough manpower to follow up on one of the most recent assaults on our patrols, and it certainly fits the bill for \"anomalous\" as you put it.  I'll send off the debriefing summary, but I doubt that will be enough to help.  There is a lot going on lately, keep asking around and maybe you can do something with all that intel."

  "dynamic_line": "我收到了很多关于袭击的报告，我想你是在替别人追踪原因吧？我很想帮忙，但我们现在的处境很艰难。我只有足够的人力来跟进最近一次对我们巡逻队的袭击，这当然符合你所说的“反常”的说法。我会把报告摘要寄出去的，但我怀疑这是否足够有用。最近有很多事情发生，继续四处打听，也许你能用这些情报做点什么。"
