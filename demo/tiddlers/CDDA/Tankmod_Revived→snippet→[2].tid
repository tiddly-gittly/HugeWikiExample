      "text": "ROBOT TANK UNVEILED - A recent press conference has confirmed the latest development in AI-driven defense systems.  Much of the details remain classified, other than the new project having only recently entered early testing.  \"We've refined some of the developments that went into the XM7 Tankette to fit an even more compact package.\" says the update, in reference to the experimental light tank program to see increased production and formal adoption in the coming months.  \"We're exploring uncharted territory with the autonomous fire control, nothing we've put into use so far has handled anything as large as a tank cannon.  Once we have all the kinks worked out we'll proceed with the next wave of trials.  We should have a working dual-core AI ready by the end of the year that can handle both the main gun and an M2 Browning, but for now we're focusing on the main gun.\""
