  "dynamic_line": "It is not that your form has strayed from the natural path.  It is the fact that these influences make your body dependent on forces that do not belong in this world.  If you are bound to the enemy, then there is a risk that your life will depend on their continued influence on this world.  We will never be able to truly reverse the damage that has been done, but mending our world might be a grave risk to those too closely tied to the Beyond.",
