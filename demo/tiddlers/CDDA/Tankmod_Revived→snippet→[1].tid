      "text": "EXPERIMENTAL TANKS TO ENTER FIELD TESTS - A press release yesterday from the Department of Defense has confirmed plans for a series of field tests for a new model of light tank, currently designated the XM7 Tankette.  A major departure from previous armor doctrine, the experimental design features a long-range electric engine and a state-of-the-art autoloader, recently upgraded to fit a 120mm main gun.  Most notable was the confirmation of a one-man crew compartment, with mention of advanced fire control and sensors rendering a commander and gunner unnecessary.  According to General Dabrowski, \"These aren't expected to replace the venerable Abrams, instead we're expecting them to find a new niche for urban warfare.  We're hoping in about a year these will cost a fourth as much as an Abrams to produce while having the same level of firepower.  For the same number of soldiers it'd take to crew one tank, we could have four of these all supporting each other, each monitoring the situation and calling in targets.\""

      "text": "美国国防部昨天发布的新闻稿证实了一种新型轻型坦克（目前命名为XM7坦克）的一系列实地测试计划。这一实验设计与以往的装甲理论有很大不同，它采用了远程电动发动机和最先进的自动装弹机，最近升级为可装120毫米主炮。最值得注意的是确认了一个人的乘员舱，并提到了先进的火力控制和传感器，使指挥官和枪手成为不必要的。根据达布罗夫斯基将军的说法，“人们并不指望这些战机能取代艾布拉姆斯，相反，我们希望他们能为城市战争找到一个新的阵地。我们希望在大约一年内，这些将花费四分之一的艾布拉姆斯生产，同时拥有同等水平的火力。对于一辆坦克的乘员人数相同的士兵来说，我们可以有四个这样的人互相支援，每个人都在监视局势并召唤目标。”"
