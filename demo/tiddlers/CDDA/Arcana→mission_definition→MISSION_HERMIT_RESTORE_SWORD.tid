    "accepted": "Wonderful.  The way forward lies within Oaths to The Chalice.  To undertake this task is to accept the responsibility that comes with it.  I will offer what advice I can, but I can't perform the purification ritual for you.  That shall be your duty.",
    "rejected": "I understand, though I hope you have not come to favor the relic's current state for its use as a weapon.  Seek me out if you deem yourself ready.",
    "advice": "You shall need the studies of those who have came before, certain ritual components.  You'll also need to seek out a copy of Sanguine Codex to properly counter the sanguine curse placed on it.",
    "inquire": "Have you performed the ritual?  Let me see it…",
    "success": "To see this, after so long… it's hard for me to put words to this.  It'll never be restored to the glory it once held, forged in fires from Beyond as one of the divine gifts, but even this gives me hope.  Come, we have much to discuss.",
    "success_lie": "What folly is this?",
