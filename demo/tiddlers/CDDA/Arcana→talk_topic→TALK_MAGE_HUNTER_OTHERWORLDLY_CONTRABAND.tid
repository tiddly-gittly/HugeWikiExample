    "I would appreciate such a gesture.  The common tools of the trade are dangerous, but I would recommend seeing Sofia about exchanging such items.  What I will accept, if you'll allow it, would be copies of the common summoner's tome.  To Master The Unknown.  If you have a copy of it to surrender, I will compensate you as best as I can.",
    "If you are willing to part with a summoner's tome, so be it.  The summoning glyphs themselves are better handled by someone more experienced like Sofia, but I will repay you for a copy of To Master The Unknown.",
    "Speak to Sofia if you seek to trust any conjurers' relics to someone else's care, but I can accept the book itself if you have one on hand.  Since this is a voluntary surrender, I will compensate you as best as I can."
