    "offer": "A large volume, the bulk of anomalous items on these shipping records, eventually found their way to a single site.  That's what we're after, and I've also figured out exactly what we need.  One of the earlier shipments on record mentions something called a dimensional focus lens.  Given what we know of the project and what they were trying to accomplish, that's the component we need to acquire to use their findings to further our own work.  Will you help us?",
    "accepted": "Thank you.  I'll give you directions to your objective.  Whatever device the component was used for, it'll likely be well-secured, unless there's been a containment breach or some other disaster.  Take apart any anomalous machinery you find down there, we don't know if it will have been used for a portable device, or a machine that'll have to be scrapped to recover the component.",

    "advice": "There's no way they haven't been overrun by now.  If you've ever explored those old facilities you'll know there's a high risk of the place crawling with undead.  Who knows what other anomalies may be there, too?  Be on your guard.",
    "inquire": "Have you found it?",
    "success": "It's just as I thought.  The culmination of several different research facilities, a project to bring these pieces together, and a very faint aura to it.  They did a lot of testing with the machinery they built, didn't they?  That helps us too.  This a lot for me to take in and analyze, give me about three days and I should have some results you might be interested in taking a look at.  In the meantime, if you have any questions I'll see what I can answer.",

    "accepted": "非常感谢。我会告诉你目标的方向。不管这个组件是用来做什么的，它都很可能是安全的，除非发生了安全壳破裂或其他灾难。把你在下面发现的任何不正常的机器拆开，我们不知道它是否会被用于便携式设备，或者必须报废才能恢复部件的机器。",
