Not long before things boiled over, I've been having strange dreams of otherworldly scenery, and now that everything's gone to hell I'm wondering if there's any meaning to it.  I know it sounds crazy, but there might be something in what I recall that we could investigate.",
    "accepted": "Thank you.  Thing is, some of the scenery from these dreams looked familiar, and after zero day I started poring over some local maps to try and make sense of what little looked real.  One of the places I recall was hidden away in a part of the local woods I used to go camping in.  I doubt we'll find anything, but maybe it'll give me peace of mind knowing these weird dreams don't have anything to do with what happened.",
    "rejected": "I understand.  We've got more important things to worry about than chasing half-remembered dreams that might not mean anything.  Maybe another time…",
    "advice": "Never know what we might run into along the way, maybe the journey will be more useful than what we find there.  The dream had a vision of strange stones and dark rituals.  If any of it turns out to be real, it might be good to visit during the daytime to be safe.",
    "inquire": "Any luck so far?",
    "success": "I don't believe it.  The stones, that cairn in the center?  It looks just just like how it appeared in the dreams.  Maybe my mind's playing tricks on me, but I could've sworn I never ran into anything like this before.  I don't know what to make of this.  I'll continue to follow you for now, maybe we can look into this further.",
    "success_lie": "What madness is this?",
    "failure": "How …?"

    "offer": "尽管事情已经变得不真实，但我一直在努力寻找答案。如果不是这样的话，至少要结束。就在一切都结束前不久，我一直在做一个奇怪的梦，梦到了另一个世界的风景，现在一切都变成了地狱，我想知道它是否有任何意义。我知道这听起来很疯狂，但我记得我们可以调查一下。",
    "accepted": "非常感谢。从零零开始，我就试着把这些熟悉的景色和一些梦境看完以后，再去看看那些真实的东西。我记得有一个地方藏在我以前露营的地方。我怀疑我们会找到什么，但也许这会让我安心，因为这些奇怪的梦与发生的事无关。",
    "rejected": "我理解。我们要担心的事情比追逐那些记不清的梦更重要，这些梦可能毫无意义。也许下次吧…",
    "advice": "永远不知道我们在路上会遇到什么，也许这段旅程会比我们在那里找到的更有用。梦里有奇怪的石头和黑暗的仪式。如果其中任何一个是真的，为了安全起见，最好在白天去看看。",
    "inquire": "到目前为止有什么进展吗？",
    "success": "我不相信。石头，中间的那个山洞？它看起来就像梦中的样子。也许我的脑子在捉弄我，但我可以发誓我从来没有遇到过这样的事情。我不知道该怎么解释。我现在会继续跟踪你，也许我们可以进一步调查。",
