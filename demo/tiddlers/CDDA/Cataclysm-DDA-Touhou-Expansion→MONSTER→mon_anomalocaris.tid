The head features two big composite eyes at the sides on top, as if they were antennas or button from some ancient console's controllers.  The animal has a fleshy \"skirt\" which undulates for allowing locomotion.  Perhaps the less revealing part is the tail, which is unquestionably that of a shrimp, telling the animal's taxonomy and culinary properties.  This would make an exotic pet, if it wasn't for its aquatic lifestyle, and that it went extinct 500 mya.",
