Living weapons, basically.  Whatever you ran into out there, don't worry.  We're all on the same side here, for all their enhancements they act more like two bored teenagers than military experiments.",
    "no": "Living weapons in a sense, but they're still as human as you or me.  All cyborged up and injected full of mutagenic treatments, doc says they lost a lot of their memories but they don't really act too much like the killing machines those eggheads wanted…"
