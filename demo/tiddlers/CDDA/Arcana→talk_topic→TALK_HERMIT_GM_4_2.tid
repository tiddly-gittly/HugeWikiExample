He From Beyond The Veil has no doubt conferred many blessings upon you, some may prove useful tools to aid you in your time of need, and no doubt many other weapons may be at your disposal.  I am hopeful then, that perseverance will see you through long enough to find your answer.",

      "yes": "You are a member of the Cleaning Flame, are you not?  I can tell by that fire in your eyes.  Perhaps it is foolish of me to lecture one of you on the virtue of determination.  As your tenets say, so long as the Sun shines upon the Earth.  I'm afraid I know too little of this interloper to guide you.  I would say only to be cautious, but that too is what your order demands, is it not?",
      "no": "I do not know what form this interloper may take, what dreadful power and madness you may face.  Be prepared for anything, but that advice is of little use to you.  That you do not lose hope is what's more useful to you.  Without that, you will not find the answers you seek."

      "no": "我不知道这个闯入者会采取什么形式，你会面临什么可怕的力量和疯狂。对任何事都要做好准备，但那建议对你没什么用处。你不要失去希望对你更有用。没有这些，你将无法找到你所寻求的答案。"
