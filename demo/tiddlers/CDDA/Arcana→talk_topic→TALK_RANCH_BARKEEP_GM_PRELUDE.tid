You hear stupid stories from drunk survivors all the time, only one I'd put stock in comes from one of the more experienced fellows, who said she had a run-in with a ghost or some shit. Out by the river.  Had a freezer burn on the back of her hand, couple hairline fractures too.  If she wasn't stone-cold sober, and one of the few scavengers I can trust not to bullshit me, I wouldn't have given her story a second thought.",
