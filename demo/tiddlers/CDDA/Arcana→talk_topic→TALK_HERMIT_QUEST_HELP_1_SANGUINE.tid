    "yes": "And yet you seem to have the mark of their order's work upon you.  This will hinder using the blade for its proper purpose, but I'm willing to trust you to help restore it at least.  However you ended up this way, it would've required one of their books.  If you don't have it in your possession, seek out their hideouts, far from civilization.",
    "no": "I'm afraid I don't have a copy of that book on hand.  I can offer you what advise I can in finding one though.  If you encounter any of their hideouts, whether hidden away in the city or far from civilization, be extremely cautious.  The text also sometimes has a habit of finding its way into the hands of wealthy collectors, and undead of unusual nature may hint at long-dead arcanists still cling to their tomes."

    "yes": "然而，你似乎有他们的订单的工作标记在你身上。这会妨碍将刀片用于正确的用途，但我愿意相信您至少会帮助恢复它。不管你以这种方式结束，都需要一本他们的书。如果你没有它，寻找他们的藏身之处，远离文明。",
    "no": "恐怕我手边没有那本书。不过，我可以为你提供我能提供的建议。如果你遇到他们的任何藏身之处，无论是隐藏在城市里还是远离文明，都要格外小心。这本书有时也习惯于落入富有收藏家的手中，具有不同寻常性质的不死生物可能暗示着早已死去的奥术主义者仍然坚持着他们的大部头。"
