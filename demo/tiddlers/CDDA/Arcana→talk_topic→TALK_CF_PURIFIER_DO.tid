      "yes": "Same network of contacts as you.  Some of us handled investigation and research, some dealt with actually getting in and grabbing whatever we were after.  From what I saw personally, most of it was just studying anomalies and staying in touch with outsiders to keep tabs on things.  Didn't ever seem to be a lot of us out there either.",
      "no": "We were part of an informal network of contacts for our brethren.  Aside from a few officials willing to look the other way, and some eccentric collectors offering their support, most of us were essentially scouts.  We'd investigate leads on potential anomalies in more… public areas, and secure them if we could.  There weren't really that many of us, just as the Cleansing Flame as a whole was stretched thin across the region."
    },
    "no": "I was what we called an \"arcane purifier\" before all this started.  Nothing but a fancy way of saying we investigated anomalies in areas where the regular hunters wouldn't exactly blend in.  Technically purifiers were just the ones focused on research and getting in touch with people, with others doing the exciting work.  But, just as the smiths and medics are still part of a hunting party, the title gets around."

      "no": "我们是兄弟们非正式联系网络的一部分。除了一些官员愿意另眼相看，还有一些古怪的收藏家表示支持，我们大多数人基本上都是童子军。我们会调查更多…公共区域潜在异常的线索，并尽可能保护他们。其实我们当中并没有那么多人，就像整个净化之火在整个地区蔓延开来一样。"
    },
    "no": "在这一切开始之前，我就是我们所说的“神秘净化器”。这只是一种花哨的说法，我们调查了那些普通猎人无法完全融入的地区的异常情况。从技术上讲，净水器只是专注于研究和与人接触，与其他人一起做令人兴奋的工作。但是，正如史密斯夫妇和医生们仍然是狩猎队的一员一样，这个头衔也流传开来。"
