  "description": "We are led by one of the brightest minds that exists during our times. The only way to rebuild this world is via infusing people with BL9, creating disciplined, fully obedient hosts ranging from regular civilians to physically enhanced soldiers and even mutated amalgamations to use as our elite soldiers.\n \n    Also, based on BL9's properties, it counters The Blob, Triffids, Mycus entirely, being absolutely benign, with a few tweaks of course, compared to others. With huge amounts of resources, weapons, materials, workforce including scientists and engineers, we can expand, assert dominance across local areas then with enough hosts, across entire country, then even across the world",
