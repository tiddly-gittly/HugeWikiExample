There, our last effort to serve Him failed.  There remains a dangerous threat that broke our order, and a fallen relic.  If I could see that relic once again, tainted though it may be, I can rest in peace when my time comes.",
    "accepted": "Thank you.  May He From Beyond The Veil guide you, or failing that whatever other gods you serve.  I will tell you where to go, but I'm afraid I can't lead you there personally.  I ask that you retrieve the cursed blade and bring it here, and then I will explain further.  Beware the unholy monsters likely to still infest the temple, and …what remains of the high priest.",
    "rejected": "I understand.  The threat that defiles the old temple is not to be underestimated.  If I felt I could make the journey, I would attempt it myself, even if I failed I could die knowing I did the right thing.  Seek my guidance if you change your mind.",
    "advice": "You will likely have to kill the abomination inhabiting the body of the temple's former high priest.  I know not what weapons he may still carry, nor what unholy power the spirit possessing him commands, but be careful and expect anything.  Most likely he will have turned our own symbol of judgment on his congregation, meaning you'll have to expect lightning magic.",
    "inquire": "Have you completed this task?",
    "success": "Excellent.  I have no need of this item, in fact you might be better suited to use it, if you are cautious.  Speak with me further and I will tell you whatever you need know.",
    "success_lie": "What folly is this?",
    "failure": "As I feared…"

    "accepted": "非常感谢。愿他从面纱之外指引你，否则，无论你侍奉什么神。我会告诉你去哪里，但恐怕我不能亲自带你去那里。我请求你取回被诅咒的刀刃并把它带到这里，然后我会进一步解释。当心那些可能仍在庙里出没的邪恶怪物，以及……大祭司的遗骸。",
