  "dynamic_line": "He has spoken of driving back the influence of other intrusions upon this realm, of returning the restless dead to their proper state, of paving the way for humanity's survival in the face of adversity.  I do not know if His will is truly out of love for humanity, but even if it isn't, if we are driven to extinction then who would ensure His will is enforced?  What dire consequences may occur should the fabric of reality deteriorate further, and no one remains to prevent it?",
