I talked it out with Ms. McKinnon and she said she can help with teaching, and we've decided to focus on scrolls.  They provide us with a relatively reusable way to deal with trouble while on a scouting run.  If you can get about five blanks for us, we'll be able to figure things out from there.",
    "accepted": "Thanks.  They seem to know their stuff well enough to assist in teaching us the basics, so once we have some blank scrolls we'll be able to make a couple of the safer ones for our scouts to use.",
    "rejected": "Alright.  Come see me if you change your mind.",
    "advice": "They mentioned that the book that teaches you how to use these items is called The Six Pillars.  If you can't find any suitable scrolls out there, that book might be useful for getting the specifications needed to make one.",
    "inquire": "Any luck so far?",
    "success": "Thank you, and here's enough of these Scales to hopefully make up for the hassle.  Least I can do.  According to Sofia, they turn blank after you activate the effects put into them.  So we'll be able to make these last a while, as long as the scavengers aren't too rough on the paper.",

    "accepted": "谢谢。他们似乎对自己的东西了如指掌，有助于教我们基础知识，所以一旦我们有了一些空白卷轴，我们就可以制作一些更安全的卷轴给我们的侦察兵使用。",
