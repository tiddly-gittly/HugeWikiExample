In the past we had few dedicated safehouses, most of us were hosted in the rural homes and churches of our brethren and those they could trust.  Only one place was truly built by our hand, and it suffered the same strange occurrences so many other places suffered during zero hour.  The handful of survivors to flee brought with them tales of living fire and otherworldly horror, warping the very stones underneath the sanctum.  If you believe yourself ready, I would like you to lead a hunt to cleanse it, and take the demon's claws as proof of the hunt.",
    "accepted": "By Thor and The God In Three Persons both, may you be victorious.  The evil lurking there was described as wielding a clawed weapon that warped The Veil itself with hellfire, until it was struck from its fiery grasp by a lucky strike.  They were able to seal it behind a barrier with one of our swords as the keystone, and you will need to undo the seal to confront it.  If you can retrieve that infernal weapon in your hunt, we will be able to destroy it safely.  I would commit a full hunting party if only we could spare anyone.  Dii vult!",
    "rejected": "Understood.  This task is dangerous, and the seal they set up shouldn't be undone unless you're prepared to see it through to the end.  Speak with me when you see fit.",
    "advice": "Bring any assistance you can, and expect all manner of abominations to have followed that thing through the wounds in The Veil.  Be prepared for infernal fire, any magic or equipment that would safeguard against flame would help.  Do as best as you can to assemble a proper hunting party, but sadly we are stretched thin as it is.",
    "inquire": "How goes the hunt?",
    "success": "Gods above and below, to think this thing caused one of our holiest places to fall to ruin.  I doubt it will be safe to reclaim that place anytime soon.  Anything you found down their is yours to use as you see fit.  I hope that those who fell holding that thing back are are peace.  Speak with me when you see fit.",
    "success_lie": "What idiocy is this?",
    "failure": "But how?"

    "accepted": "托尔和上帝在三个人身上，祝你胜利。潜伏在那里的邪恶被描述为挥舞着利爪的武器，用地狱之火扭曲了帷幕，直到它被一次幸运的一击从它炽热的手中击中。他们能够用我们的一把剑作为基石把它封住，你需要解开封印来对抗它。如果你能在狩猎中找回那凶器，我们就能安全地摧毁它。如果我们能放过任何一个人，我会安排一个完整的狩猎队。迪伊·瓦特！",

    "success": "上上下下的诸神，想想这件事导致了我们最神圣的地方之一的毁灭。我怀疑很快收回那个地方是否安全。你从他们那里找到的任何东西都是你的，只要你觉得合适就可以使用。我希望那些阻止这件事的人是和平的。你觉得合适的时候跟我说。",
