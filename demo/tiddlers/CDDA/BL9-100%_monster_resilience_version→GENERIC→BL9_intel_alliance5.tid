  "description": "Honestly, Arganoides are interested mainly in using it as a high quality fuel for their spaceships, more efficient locating tech for acquiring rare valuable items. Wanzeltiums want to use it for creating more durable and unique building materials, improving their existing tech and weapons via infusing it with BL9.\n \n    Davranides crave to significantly advance their existent mutation, splicing research in an attempt to make their race genetically superior via their own efforts. Saldeniums show interest in upgrading their armor and weapons with it, enhancing their current energy-based physically boosting accessories with BL9 to provide even greater strength to them, of course, creating BL9 monstrosities to instill fear into their enemies and conquer them",
