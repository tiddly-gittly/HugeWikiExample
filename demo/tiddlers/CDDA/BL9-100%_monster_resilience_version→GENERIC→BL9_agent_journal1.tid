  "description": "I am an agent working on one of the remnants of many secret organizations that existed before Cataclysm. I was born in one of it's main hidden facilities, my father was a retired military officer who was hired as a mercenary and worked long for this organization.\n \n    Obviously, such organizations had and many still have many hidden facilities, vaults, many different structures, an unbelievable amount of resources to feed and supply multiple generations' of survivors and it's agents' offspring.\n \n    For many years I've been training diligently to become not just a survivor and a scavenger - but an agent who can search and scavenge for rare resources as well along with the basic ones. However, our own leader betrayed us, selling us to 'THEM', hoping to be one of 'THEIR' allies in New World that 'THEY' want to build.\n \n    'THEY' have killed, abducted many of our people, but many of us have also managed to escape. We've made a secret BL9 research base thanks to Ulysses along with many of our scientists who believe that we can modify it to be safe, beneficial even to use for equipment or even drugs. I try to do my best to strive if not for flourishment but at the very least continued existence along with survival of our organization, my people...",

  "description": "我是一名特工，在大灾难前存在的许多秘密组织的残余组织中工作。我出生在它的一个主要隐蔽设施里，我父亲是一名退休军官，被雇佣为雇佣军，长期为这个组织工作。\n\n显然，这样的组织有很多隐藏的设施、金库、许多不同的结构、难以置信的资源来喂养和供应几代幸存者及其代理人的后代。\n\n多年来，我一直在努力训练，不仅要成为一名幸存者和拾荒者，还要成为一名能够搜索和拾荒者，寻找稀有资源和基本资源的特工。然而，我们自己的领导人背叛了我们，把我们卖给了“他们”，希望成为“他们”想要建立的新世界中的“他们”盟友之一。\n\n“他们”杀害、绑架了我们的许多人，但我们中的许多人也设法逃脱了。多亏了尤利西斯和我们的许多科学家，我们已经建立了一个秘密的BL9研究基地，他们相信我们可以将其修改为安全的，甚至有益于用于设备甚至药物。我尽我最大的努力奋斗，即使不是为了繁荣昌盛，但至少是为了我们组织、我的人民的生存而继续生存......",
