    "If you have access to any sort of protection against electricity, use it.  Most of them have electric discharge weaponry implanted in them, and those that don't have been known to mutilate their power generation augmentations to improvise.",
    "Even with how much they've been through, their medical implants are usually still operational.  If you commit to an attack, keep up the pressure.  If you have to break contact, they'll have likely regenerated by the time you next run into them.",
    "I'd recommend against taking them on in close combat, unless you're likewise fairly well-enhanced.  Keep a safe distance and pour a high volume of fire into them.  Only a few of the completed bio-weapons had any integrated ranged weaponry, so it'll be safer than going toe-to-toe with them.",
    "If you can deliver effective fire with something high-caliber, or even explosive, you should have good odds of taking one out in a single shot.  Be prepared for the chance they might limp away from it though, these things are tougher than they look.",
    "It's a bit like fighting some of the nastier undead out there, if you get caught in close combat with more than one of them, you're not going to last long.  Be careful too, even with all those bionic malfunctions they might outpace you.",
    "I'm sure they can tell the living apart from the dead, but that doesn't make them any friend of the zombies.  The undead seem to regard them with the same hostility as any other living human."

    "使用你获得的任何形式的电击防护装备。他们大多数都植入了放电武器，而那些还不知道如何破坏他们的放电增强装置的人只能自制防电装备了。",
    "即使他们经历了这么多，他们的医疗植入物通常还能正常工作。如果你决定进攻那就保持攻击。如果你停止攻击，他们很可能在你下次遇到时就已经复活了。",
    "我建议不要在近战中与他们对抗，除非你的能力也相当强。保持安全距离并且向他们猛烈开火。只有少数完成改造的生物武器拥有集成远程武器，所以这会比与他们面对面更安全。",
    "如果你能用大口径的东西，甚至是爆炸性的东西进行有效的射击，你应该有很大的几率一枪就能干掉一个。但要做好准备，他们可能会一瘸一拐地离开，这些事情比看起来要难。",
    "这有点像在和一些更难对付的丧尸作战，如果你与多个敌人进行近距离战斗，你无法坚持很久的。也要小心，即使它们有许多故障的生化插件，它们的速度可能也比你快。",
    "我相信他们能区分生者和死者，但这并不能让他们成为丧尸的朋友。似乎它们对丧尸与人类抱有同样的敌意。"
