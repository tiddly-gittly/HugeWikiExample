  "dynamic_line": "The most important research we have comes from the intel Sofia gathered before we arrived here.  The Keepers in particular had some valuable insights into sealing portals.  We may have our differences, but they had a genuine advantage that we've never been able to replicate before.  But if we can salvage what's left of Project Kairos and combine it with their findings, I'm hoping that will change.",
