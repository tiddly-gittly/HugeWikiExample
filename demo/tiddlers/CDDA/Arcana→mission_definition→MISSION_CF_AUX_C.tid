Personally, I just want to go about my duties here as best as I'm able, and I think the best way to keep my superiors from causing trouble would be if I provided them with information that'd give them good reason to work with this place, instead of working against them.  I have something in mind that'd kill two birds with one stone, as it were.  If you can provide me with a copy of their medical text, History of Alchemy, I'll be able to better treat people here, and it'll give me a bargaining chip to keep things civil between the locals and my superiors.",

    "success": "Thank you.  I've already been in contact with my CO and they're interested in getting more intel as well.  I'm still a little concerned, but I feel a bit more confident that they aren't going to do anything rash.  As promised, fair payment and a little something extra.  This is an RX-12 stimulant delivery module.  You might find it useful for emergencies.  Came in with the latest gear shipment.",
