  "description": "I've grown in one of our organization's core centers, my father is a bright very experienced symbiotes scientist, yet he's a very kind, humane person, he wants me to be a scientist. My mother is a former scientist who mutated into a very graceful plant humanoid, retaining most of her humanity. She abandoned us, because she feared of what our own people could do to our family for having a mutant as a member of our organization. Years after I've grown indifferent to my father's work.\n \n    'THEY' attacked our core center, our own leader betrayed all of us. Hundreds of our people killed, kidnapped, abducted. Hundreds of mutated soldiers, vile creatures with inhumane strength and agility. Some of us escaped like my father with some scientists, workers and our main agent. I didn't follow them, running to labs, I've injected myself with one of experimental symbiotes, BL9, my father has been working on it for years. Managed to use my new abilities to escape, alone. I search for remnants of our organization, I know they exist, I know they along with my father have survived. With this intel, journals, survivors could help me, our organization to fight our enemies successfully hopefully as well",
