    "no": "I haven't been able to check back with them in a while, and I know they need all the help they can get.  If you can take the time to pay them a visit, speak with Sofia.  She leads the group of survivors sheltering there, and she may have work for you.  I'll go ahead and mark it on your map as best as I can, but you'll need to find it on your own."
