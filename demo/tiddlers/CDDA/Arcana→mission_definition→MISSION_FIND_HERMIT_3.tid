This isn't giving me any answers or even any closure, just more questions.  One thing stood out though.  A house of some sort, and in that dream I didn't just see images of it.  I saw someone traveling there, and a shadow of something otherworldly hanging over the place.  Thinking on what I recalled was calming, for some reason.  Maybe we'll find something?",

    "rejected": "I understand.  But this was the one dream, out of all the weird shit I can remember, that actually felt like more than just a warning, or omen, or whatever the hell the rest have been.",
    "advice": "It was a rural house of sort sort.  Nothing dangerous or even weird stood out in that dream.  In fact it seemed like the most mundane out of the bunch, but there was this sense of foreboding, and what happened in it was so much more vivid.",
    "inquire": "Any luck so far?",
    "success": "Looks like the place.  I can see signs of the house being inhabited.  The place looks so familar even though this is the first time I've ever laid eyes on it in the waking world.  Maybe the dreams were visions of the future, if so I'm guessing that one was about traveling here, not just an omen or whatever.  I'll let you decide what to do if we meet anyone here, I don't know if the other dreams will do us much good.  At least trying to make sense of them, seeing these places in person made me feel, I don't know, better.  Less uneasy.  Thank you.",

    "success": "看起来像是那个地方。我能看到房子有人住的迹象。尽管这是我第一次在清醒的世界里看到它，但它看起来还是那么的亲切。也许梦是对未来的憧憬，如果是这样的话，我猜是关于在这里旅行，而不仅仅是一个预兆或其他什么。如果我们在这里遇到任何人，我会让你决定怎么做，我不知道其他的梦是否会对我们有多大好处。至少想弄清楚这些地方，亲眼看到这些地方让我感觉，我不知道，感觉好多了。不那么不安。非常感谢。",
