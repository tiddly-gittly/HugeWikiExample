Decades ago the place was inhabited, but now the place seems to be overgrown and infested with monsters.  Do what you must to cleanse the place, and retrieve what the texts called a bane staff.

I would expect monsters comfortable among greenery to be the most common threat, and we have reason to believe something large has taken root there.  Beyond that, I can tell you little of the history behind that place, Sofia might know more.",

    "success": "Thank you.  That staff was associated with those who once inhabited that place, but it seems whatever anomalies caused all this corrupted it to some extent.  I will care for it, anything else you found down there you may deal with as you see fit.  The rest of us will try to discern just what to make of these anomalies.",
