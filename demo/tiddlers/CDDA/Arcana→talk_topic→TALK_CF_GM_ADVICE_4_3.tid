  "dynamic_line": "They lost him, waited over a day before leaving.  They were instructed not to assault the facility due to the risk of too many of our people being exposed, even if his life was at risk.  That place is going to be dangerous, even if they've succumbed to the apocalypse by now.  However good the intentions of their main project might have been, there's no telling what evils they might have inflicted on the world in the process.",
