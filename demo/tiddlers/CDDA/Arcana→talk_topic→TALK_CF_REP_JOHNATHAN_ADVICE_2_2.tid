The mere nature of our work down there, dismantling dangerous objects recovered on hunts, evidently allowed such things to happen even there, despite all our efforts to be cautious.  The hunters there held off what came crawling out from Beyond as best as they could, but they couldn't… I'm sorry.  It's unavoidable in our line of work, but we lost so many down there, that day.  Whatever fate the gods mandate for them, I hope they are at peace.",
