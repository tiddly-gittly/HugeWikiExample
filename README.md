## Credits

Data is generated from a game mod [CDDA-Kenan-Modpack-Chinese](https://github.com/linonetwo/CDDA-Kenan-Modpack-Chinese), game developers are amazing!

## Development

There are some scripts you can run.

After `pnpm i`: (install pnpm first. Or you can use `npm i` instead)

- `pnpm run dev` to auto pack the plugin and run a demo site. Your change in the src directory will automatically refresh the site.
- `pnpm run dev-html` to see demo site with packed plugin after you finish your development, this can be your final check, this runs slower than `npm run dev`
